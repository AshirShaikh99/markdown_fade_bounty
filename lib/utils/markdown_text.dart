We’re building an LLM based tool for one of our FilledStacks clients. 
  ''',
  '''

  ''',
  '''
The text comes back as it 
  ''',
  '''
is being completed. 
  ''',
  '''
Here’s an example of how
  ''',
  '''
paragraph would be returned:
  ''',
  '''
**The full paragraph**

“I need every new
  ''',
  '''
word being added to the text to animate i
  ''',
  '''
n using a fade functionality. This an
  ''',
  '''
example of this can be seen when using Gemini chat.”
  ''',
  '''
**How it’s returned**

“I need”
  ''',
  '''
“I need every new word”
  ''',
  '''
“I need every new word
  ''',
  '''
being added to”
  ''',
  '''
“I need every new word being
  ''',
  '''
added to the text”
  ''',

“I need every new word being added to the text to animate in”
